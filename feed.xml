<p>The California Homebrew Circuit (CHBC) is a free, community-driven initiative connecting homebrewers across the state through friendly competition, shared learning, and cross-club collaboration.</p><h3 id="how-competitions-are-selected">How Competitions Are Selected</h3>
<p>To be included in the CHBC standings, competitions must meet the following criteria:</p><ul>
<li><strong>BJCP-Sanctioned:</strong> Only competitions sanctioned by the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) are considered.</li>
<li><strong>California-Based:</strong> The competition must be held within the state of California.</li>
<li><strong>Open and Inclusive:</strong> Events must be accessible to the broader homebrewing community.</li>
<li><strong>Standard Format:</strong> Specialty competitions limited to specific styles, ingredients, or themes are not eligible.</li>
<li><strong>Results Transparency:</strong> Competitions must publicly share complete results using a standardized format (e.g., table with brewer, category, beer name, and medal).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each season, we aim to include 12‚Äì16 well-established and geographically diverse competitions. Selection favors events with a history of strong participation, fair judging, and reliable results reporting.</p><h3 id="scoring-system">Scoring System</h3>
<p>We use a standardized point system based on medal placements:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Gold ‚Äì 3 points</strong></li>
<li><strong>Silver ‚Äì 2 points</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bronze ‚Äì 1 point</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Points are awarded to individual brewers (or co-brewers) per placing entry. Best of Show and special awards may be highlighted but are not weighted differently in the leaderboard.</p><p>If a competition includes a <strong>‚ÄúDouble Gold‚Äù</strong> or similar designation, it is counted as a single Gold placement unless clarified otherwise by the organizer.</p><h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>
<p>Results are gathered from:</p><ul>
<li>Publicly posted competition result sheets (PDF, Google Sheets, HTML, etc.)</li>
<li>Direct communication with competition coordinators</li>
<li>Club announcements and newsletters</li>
</ul>
<p>Efforts are made to verify accuracy and to attribute points to the correct individuals and clubs. If you spot an error or omission, please <a href="#">contact us</a> and we‚Äôll correct it promptly.</p><h3 id="result-standardization">Result Standardization</h3>
<p>To ensure fairness and consistency across the circuit, all competitions must publish results that:</p><ul>
<li>Clearly identify brewers, beer names, BJCP categories/subcategories, and award placements</li>
<li>Be available via public link, official website, or verifiable documentation</li>
<li>Be posted in a timely manner following the event</li>
</ul>
<p>CHBC reserves the right to delay or exclude competitions from the current season if results are incomplete, unverifiable, or posted in nonstandard formats.</p><h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<p>The current season runs from <strong>January 1 to December 31, 2025</strong>. Results are updated monthly (or as competitions report).</p>
