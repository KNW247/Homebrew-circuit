<h2>Transparency & Community Involvement</h2>
<p>
  CHBC is a work in progress, and transparency is a core value. All updates, rule changes, and discussions happen openly on our planning Discord. Anyone is welcome to observe or contribute.
</p>
<p>
  While this circuit is currently run by a single volunteer, the long-term goal is to build a small planning team with representatives from both Northern and Southern California. This will help ensure the circuit stays fair, responsive, and community-driven as it evolves.

  If you're interested in helping out — even in a small way — reach out via Discord or email. Every bit of help makes a difference.
