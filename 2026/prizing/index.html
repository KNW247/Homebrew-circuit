      Shipping is not included for these packages.
    </p>

    <h2>✅ Eligibility & Opt-In Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      To keep prize distribution fair and manageable, <strong>brewers must actively opt in</strong> 
      to be eligible for prize packages.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Opt-In Required:</strong> Brewers must complete the official CHBC prize
        <a href="/2026/prize-opt-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opt-in form</a> 
        to be eligible for any All-State or Division prizes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Pickup Confirmation (Division Prizes):</strong> When opting in, brewers in the 
        North and South Divisions must confirm that they are able to pick up prizes at the designated
        MoreBeer! showroom.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deadline:</strong> Opt-in must be completed by the published deadline (to be announced on
        the main dashboard and Discord). Brewers who do not opt in by the deadline will not be eligible
        for prize packages.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔁 Prize Roll-Down Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If a brewer in a prize-eligible position is <strong>not eligible</strong> or unable to receive a prize, 
      that prize will be awarded to the next eligible brewer:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a top finisher did not complete the opt-in form, their prize spot is forfeited and 
        <strong>all lower prizes shift down</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        For Division (North/South) prizes, if a brewer cannot reasonably pick up at the MoreBeer! showroom,
        their prize position is forfeited and all prizes shift down to the next eligible brewer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prize roll-down continues until all available prize positions are either filled by eligible brewers
        or exhausted.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Example: If the 1st place South Division brewer does not opt in, the 2nd place brewer moves up to 
      the 1st-place prize package, 3rd place moves up to the 2nd-place package, and the 4th-place brewer 
      (if eligible) receives the 3rd-place package.
    </p>

    <h2>📝 Notes & Disclaimers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Prize details are subject to minor adjustments based on product availability at MoreBeer!/MoreFlavor!.
        Any changes will be communicated on the main CHBC site and Discord.
      </li>
      <li>
        CHBC and MoreBeer! reserve the right to substitute prizes of comparable value if a listed item becomes
        unavailable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taxes, local regulations, and any additional fees are the responsibility of the recipient where applicable.
      </li>
