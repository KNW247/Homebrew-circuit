  <h1>üìò CHBC Methodology</h1>

  <div class="panel">

    <p>The California Homebrew Circuit (CHBC) is a free, community-driven initiative connecting homebrewers across the state through friendly competition, shared learning, and cross-club collaboration.</p>

    <h2>How Competitions Are Selected</h2>
    <p>To be included in the CHBC standings, competitions must meet the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>BJCP-Sanctioned:</strong> Only competitions sanctioned by the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) are considered.</li>
      <li><strong>California-Based:</strong> The competition must be held within the state of California.</li>
      <li><strong>Open and Inclusive:</strong> Events must be accessible to the broader homebrewing community.</li>
      <li><strong>Standard Format:</strong> Specialty competitions limited to specific styles, ingredients, or themes are not eligible.</li>
      <li><strong>Results Transparency:</strong> Competitions must publicly share complete results using a standardized format.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each season, we aim to include 10‚Äì14 well-established and geographically diverse competitions. Selection favors events with a history of strong participation, quality judging, and reliable results reporting.</p>

    <h2>üèÖ Scoring System</h2>
    <p>In 2025, CHBC adopted a <strong>weighted points system</strong> that takes into account the size of each competition table. Points are awarded as follows:</p>

    <h3>Category Placements</h3>
    <p>Points are calculated using this formula:</p>
    <p><code>Points = ((Entries - Place) / Entries)¬≥</code></p>
    <p>This rewards brewers more for winning in larger, more competitive tables.</p>

    <h3>Best of Show Bonuses</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Best of Show (1st) ‚Äì 2.7 bonus points</li>
      <li>Best of Show (2nd) ‚Äì 1.6 bonus points</li>
      <li>Best of Show (3rd) ‚Äì 0.7 bonus points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>BOS points are awarded in addition to any category placement points earned by the same entry.</p>

    <h2>Co-Brewer Policy</h2>
    <p>If a beer lists more than one brewer, we‚Äôll give <strong>circuit points to the first name listed</strong> by default.</p>
    <p>If you want the points to go to someone else (like the second brewer or a team name), just <strong>message us on Discord</strong> and we‚Äôll sort it out. Easy.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Results are gathered from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Publicly posted competition result sheets (PDF, Google Sheets, HTML, etc.)</li>
      <li>Direct communication with competition coordinators</li>
      <li>Club announcements and newsletters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Efforts are made to verify accuracy and to attribute points to the correct individuals and clubs. If you spot an error or omission, please reach out on our Discord:  
      üëâ <a href="https://discord.gg/YOUR-INVITE-CODE" target="_blank">Join the CHBC Discord</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Result Standardization</h2>
    <p>To ensure fairness and consistency across the circuit, all competitions must publish results that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clearly identify brewers, beer names, BJCP categories/subcategories, and award placements</li>
      <li>Be available via public link, official website, or verifiable documentation</li>
      <li>Be posted in a timely manner following the event</li>
    </ul>
    <p>CHBC reserves the right to delay or exclude competitions from the current season if results are incomplete, unverifiable, or posted in nonstandard formats.</p>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>The current season runs from <strong>January 1 to December 31, 2025</strong>. Results are updated monthly (or as competitions report).</p>
